# Technical Stack and Architecture

## Core Technologies

### Speech Recognition
- Whisper Large V3 Turbo
- PyTorch (for model inference)
- CUDA support for GPU acceleration

### Audio Processing
- PyAudio for real-time audio capture
- Librosa for audio feature extraction
- SciPy for signal processing
- Beamformit for microphone array processing

### Computer Vision
- MediaPipe for face mesh and lip detection
- OpenCV for video capture and processing
- FaceNet for face recognition
- TensorFlow for emotion recognition models

### Development Environment
- Python 3.8+
- CUDA Toolkit
- FFmpeg for media processing

## Architecture Decisions

### Real-time Processing
- Parallel processing for audio and video streams
- Queue-based pipeline for continuous data flow
- Buffer management for synchronization

### Model Optimization
- Quantization for faster inference
- Batch processing where applicable
- GPU acceleration for neural networks

### Data Flow
1. Audio/Video Capture → Parallel Processing
2. Audio → Feature Extraction → Speaker Diarization
3. Video → Face Detection → Lip Movement → Expression Analysis
4. Multimodal Fusion → Final Output

### System Requirements
- NVIDIA GPU (8GB+ VRAM recommended)
- Multiple microphone array support
- HD camera for facial recognition
- 16GB+ RAM
- SSD for model storage and fast loading
